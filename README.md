#  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain

This project explores **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using the LangChain framework. The goal is to build an intelligent system that answers questions using both pre-trained language models and external knowledge from documents. Instead of relying solely on the language model’s fixed knowledge, we retrieve relevant context to improve accuracy and relevance—especially useful for domain-specific queries.

##  Project Motivation

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are powerful, but they can still produce outdated or incorrect answers. RAG solves this by:
- Retrieving relevant document chunks based on the user's query.
- Combining the flexibility of LLMs with the precision of document retrieval.


##  Tools & Tech Stack

- **LangChain**
- **Embeddings:** HuggingFace, OpenAI, or Ollama
- **Vector Store:** FAISS or Chroma
- **LLM Backend:** Ollama (Mistral, LLaMA2, Gemma2)
- **Document Loaders:** PyMuPDF, PDFMiner, etc.
- **Google Colab:** For interactive experimentation

##  Tasks Breakdown

###  Task 3: Basic RAG Setup (Document → Answer)
- Load a PDF/text file.
- Split it into chunks.
- Convert chunks to embeddings.
- Store embeddings in a vector store (FAISS/Chroma).
- Retrieve relevant chunks and generate answers using LLM.

###  Task 4: Advanced Retrieval + Multiple Model Support
- Added flexibility to use multiple embedding models.
- Integrated better chunking for large documents.
- Supports switching between HuggingFace, OpenAI, and Ollama backends.

###  Task 5: Inference & Evaluation
- User can input questions dynamically.
- System retrieves relevant context and responds using the selected model.
- Evaluation of model answers based on correctness and context relevance.

##  Key Concepts Explained

- **Vector Store:** Stores document chunks as numerical vectors for efficient retrieval.
- **Retriever:** Fetches relevant document chunks based on semantic similarity.
- **Stuff / Map Reduce / Refine (LangChain Chains):**
  - `Stuff`: Simple concatenation of docs.
  - `Map Reduce`: Independently processes chunks, then aggregates.
  - `Refine`: Iteratively improves the answer with each chunk.
